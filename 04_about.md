<h4>Hi there, I'm Rick Allen and I'd like to tell you a bit about myself,</h4>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
I'm an energetic, hard working, and determined IT professional. Currently I'm working as a Network Administrator but my passion for IT has led me in many directions. I've been learning a lot about Cloud, Machine Learning, and DevOps. Recently I have completed my AWS cloud foundational course from Amazon, and I'm extremely excited to begin working in AWS. Shortly after I began more in depth studying of Machine Learning. This has led me to begin practical implementation projects of ML, all of which are, or will be, published to my GitHub. If you haven't worked with ML before, the amount of math required doesn't cross your mind until you're in the thick of it. Just a warning haha.

<h4>Machine Learning</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
I'm just starting off with ML and right now I'm learning all about how neural networks work, how to calculate error, and how to use gradient decent to locate a set of variables that produce the least amount of error. Of course all this requires lots of coding, and so I'm working almost every day to publish work to my GitHub every day. Be sure to check it out from the link at the bottom of the page!

<h4>My Current Projects</h4>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Python 3 </b> - Practice makes perfect </li>
  <li> <b> Machine Learning </b> - Let's do some math! </li>
  <li> <b> AWS </b> - Working to achieve my AWS professional DevOps Cert </li>
  <li> <b> Docker</b> - Learning Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernettes </li>
</ul>


<h4>My Hobbies</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
Asside from just IT, I have lots of other hobbies. I like to keep myself busy, but it's important not to burn yourself out on learning. I make sure to give myself breaks doing things that I love. I really enjoy working with my hands, so generally my free time activities are related to building or painting models. I play a game called Warhammer 40K on Friday nights with my friends, I like to build and Gundam models, and of course I love my fair share of video games.
