    <h4>Networking and Education</h4>
    <p>This is where I got my foundation. Networking is the field that officially drug me into the world of IT. Back in high school I attended a vocational schooling for Cisco Networking and Security Technologies. It was a program put on by Cisco, through their NetAcad program. Over the course I studied networking with an end goal of obtaining my CCNA. After graduating high school I went on to college to continue my education, once again in IT. Through this course I studied prerequisit material for my CCNA Security, CCNA Collab, and Linux technologies. I later went on to obtain my CCNP R&S.</p>
