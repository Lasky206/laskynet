To anyone who may be reading, welcome!

I've decided to take a more decorative approach to sharing my projects with the world. With this page, I hope to share some of the things that I have learned with other. Primarily the following, document my journey on the path to DevOps, share code, and report on discoveries that I make along the way. I hope some of you out there are able to take something away from what I have learned!
