<h4>Hi there,</h4>

<body>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
My name is Rick Allen. Currently I work as a network administrator on the OPS side of things, but I'm striving to become a DevOps engineer. Of course that's no small feat. In fact its got me working on lots of different projects concurrently. Here are a few of the projects my journey has got me working on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b> Python 3 </b> - practice makes perfect </li>
  <li> <b> Django </b> - adding a front end to some apps I'm working on </li>
  <li> <b> AWS </b> - working to achieve my AWS professional DevOps Cert </li>
  <li> <b> Jenkins </b> - to study and get more hands on experience with CI/CD pipeline </li>
  <li> <b> Docker</b> - Learning Docker, Docker Swarm, and Kubernettes </li>
</ul>
