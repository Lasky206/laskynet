<h4>Let's talk Machine Learning,</h4>

<body>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
I'm pretty new to Machine Learning, but it is something that really interests me. The practical implementations of ML in all kinds of fields that I've seen have captivated me. Now I'm hooked. So far I have been studying on my own through various resources including: YouTube, blogs, math learning websites, and more. while this is definitely something I'm new to, I'll be publishing all my projects to my GitHub page. So be sure to check out my GitHub page to see what I'm working on!
